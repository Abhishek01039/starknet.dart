# starknet.dart

Dart SDK for StarkNet ‚ú®

The goal of this dart package is to be able to call any JSON-RPC endpoint exposed by the StarkNet nodes (see the [specs](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs)) in a type-safe way from any dart application.

## Motivation

StarkNet is a revolution in the web3 world: it allows to [scale Ethereum](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/) and offers the best possible UX thanks to unique features like [account abstraction](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/wtf-is-account-abstraction/) or [session keys](https://github.com/dontpanicdao/starknet-burner).

But web3 mainstream adoption won't happen unless decentralized applications go to mobile.

That's why it's a priority to **build the best possible Starknet SDK for dart applications**, thus unlocking the era of Flutter mobile apps on StarkNet.
